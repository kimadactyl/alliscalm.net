# “Agriculture": Soundscape recordings from 2007”

These are some field recordings I made in 2007 as part of my BA(Hons) dissertation. Despite the age I still really like these, especially the storm drain. At the time I was in a band called "Agriculture", but I still really like this name so I'm sticking with it. I uploaded them all to Bandcamp in high quality - enjoy!
