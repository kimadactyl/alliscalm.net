# Idea: Looting Data vs. MPs' Expenses vs. Banking Crisis

As with many UK residents, I feel the sentences handed down to people involved in the [UK riots](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/london-riots) (or incredibly tenuously involved) are hugely disproportionate to those given to [MPs](http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/mps-expenses) and [bankers](http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2011/sep/12/reality-check-banking-bailout) responsible for stealing or defrauding much larger amounts.

Been talking to [Alice](http://kaerast.info/) about setting up a small Ruby app similar to [Speed Of Animals](http://www.speedofanimals.com/) that would have three columns, comparing all of them to one metric (MPs, say).

1.  Banking cost to economy — Arrests — Sentences given. Underneath a list of all related arrests.
2.  MPs expenses cost to economy — Arrests — Sentences given. Underneath a list of all related arrests.
3.  Rioting cost to economy — Arrests — Sentences given. Underneath a list of all related arrests.
There's too many complications it feels like here - a lot of the data is semi-qualitative, or hard to decode in a meaningful way. Also, MPs can legitimately claim some expenses, and the half a million pounds payback (oh, if you defraud someone and pay it back you get off! [and by the way have your seat in the Lords back](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Taylor_of_Warwick)) complicates matters.

Nevertheless, the ideas there if anyone wants it. I have a domain name if anyone can make good use of it (looting.us). Relevant data sources:

Thanks as always to[ Alice](http://kaerast.info/) for links and data sources!
